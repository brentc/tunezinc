There's lots to do! The initial release was hacked together over a day, and could use a bunch of work re-organizing
code and re-implementing logic.

## Short Term

1. Better output, python.logging isn't pretty
1. Prompt for passwords rather than pulling them from environment
1. A better way to specify the playlists to sync
1. Re-implement song-matching logic, it's a nightmare
1. Tests (*sigh*)

## Long Term

1. Sync back from Spotify to Gmusic
1. Support more services
1. UI of some sort?
