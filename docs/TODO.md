## Short Term

1. Better output, python.logging isn't pretty
1. Prompt for passwords rather than pulling them from environment
1. A better way to specify the playlists to sync
1. Re-implement song-matching logic, it's a nightmare

## Long Term

1. Sync back from Spotify to Gmusic
1. Support more services
1. UI of some sort?
